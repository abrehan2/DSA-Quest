Linked List is better than Array in the following ways:
-> You dont need to pre-allocate space
-> Insertion is easier

-> BigO of Linked List traversal is O(n)
-> Accessing element by value is O(n)

Uses of Linked List:
-> Stacks and queues
-> Image gallery
-> Music player
-> Browser
-> Hash map and hash set (whenever there is a collision we handle it with chaining using doubly linked list)
